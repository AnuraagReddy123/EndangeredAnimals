# SaveTigers


## Description

### Problem
Our project is concerned with SDG Goal 15 Life on Land

We made a user-friendly game with easy levels and a simple storyline through
which the player can understand how an endangered animal is trying to survive
in a world with threats like poachers and hunters.
