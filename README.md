# SaveTigers

## Description

Our project is concerned with SDG Goal 15 Life on Land

We made a user-friendly game with easy levels and a simple storyline through
which the player can understand how an endangered animal is trying to survive
in a world with threats like poachers and hunters.

## Characters
### Player (Hyena)
In the whole game, the player is a hyena which is just showcasing the life of an
animal, specifically an endangered animal. The player has to struggle hard to 
survive because his species is being hunted by human beings. The player has to go
through harder levels as he struggles to survive with ongoing time.
### Hunter: 
The antagonist of our player which is none other than human beings. They are trying
to mindlessly kill the animals for their personal interests and the land animals 
are struggling to survive.
### Snake: 
This is just a simple food item which our player must collect so that it can stay 
alive. The more he eats, the more happy he is. 

## Levels
### Level 1:  
This level introduces the player to hyena which is an endangered animal and tells 
about how its life must have been affected due to hunters and poachers. The player
can learn how to jump and move around in the level. This is just an introductory 
level with no threats.
### Level 2: 
This level introduces the player to the eating lifestyle of the animal. The animal 
needs to eat to survive . So the player can try collecting food and the more he 
collects, the more points he gets.
### Level 3: 
This level introduces the animal’s greatest threat which is none other than human 
beings. The hyena must dodge the attacks of hunters and survive simultaneously.
This is a life an animal has to live with in today’s world.
### Level 4: 
This level is just a harder version of the previous level which shows how as time goes 
on , the life of animals becomes harder as more and more hunters and poachers are 
coming and killing them.
### Level 5:
This is an even harder version where life of animals is becoming even harder and 
it is a real challenge for it to survive now. It must make sure that it doesn’t get 
attacked by any human and also eats enough so that it can stay alive. The hard levels 
are trying to show how this animals need to be protected otherwise they will go extinct.
